# Diabetes Prediction

Ongoing data analysis project with the intended goal of analyzing the risk factors associated with diabetes and training models to predict whether a respondent has diabetes.

# Dataset

The CSV on which this analysis takes place is taken from an dataset entry in Kaggle.com, called ["Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset).

# Tools Used

Some tools used include:

* Python (w/ numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) - used to train Logistic Regression classification models to predict diabetes factors
* SQL (SQLite specifically) and DB Browser for SQLite - used to group respondents together based on gender and responses to various questions (i.e. does the respondent have high blood pressure, etc).
* Microsoft Excel - used to perform basic analysis and visualization on data gleaned from SQL queries
